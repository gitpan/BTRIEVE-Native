NAME

  BTRIEVE::Native - Interface to Btrieve ISAM file manager

DESCRIPTION

  This is a simple wrapper for the Btrieve single function API.

INSTALLATION

  To install this module type the following:

     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test
     make install

PREREQUISITES

  This module is tested on Windows NT 4.0 with the Microkernel
  Interface  DLL (WBTRV32.DLL) version 6.15 from Btrieve
  Technologies, Inc.
  On that platform, it requires WBTRV32.DLL in your PATH,
  e.g.:

    set PATH=\opt\btrieve\bin;%PATH%

  To satisfy the linker, an import library may be required, e.g. WBTRV32.lib.
  For Borland C++ 5.5, the generated .def file is used.
  For MinGW, copy WBTRV32.DLL to WBTRV32.a.
